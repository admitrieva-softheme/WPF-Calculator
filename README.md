                                              ---WPF Calculator---
This is an quick example I made for a blog post (Here: ) which I demonstrate some testing in Visual Studio 2010 using
C# and WPF. The code deliberately has bugs as well as poor coding so I can use the tools to fix them. Master branch
has the rough version where as the other branches will have a version with tests as well as a version which has the
bugs and coding quality improved.
